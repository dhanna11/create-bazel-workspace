From https://github.com/quittle/bazel_android_sdk_downloader:

    $ bazel run @androidsdk//install

This will attempt to download the SDK for the versions specified. If you change
these values, clean the workspace, or check it out fresh, you will need to
re-run this command to download and install the SDK again.
